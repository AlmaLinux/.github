# Contribute to AlmaLinux

Contributions to the AlmaLinux project come in all shapes and sizes. We have a number of ways to contribute outlined in our [wiki](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Contribute.html). If you are interested in contributing to this repo or any part of the AlmaLinux project, we recommend you follow these guidelines.

## Prerequisites
Before you start working on a problem:

* Look through existing open and closed issues for similar content, to prevent duplication.
* Open an issue on the repo to propose your content or code change before you begin writing it to ensure that is appropriate for the project.
* Comment on any open issues or bug reports that you would like to take ownership of so that work isn't duplicated. 
* If you submit a pull request, outline in detail the reason for the changes you made, and ensure that you reference the open issue or bug report that you are attempting to resolve.
